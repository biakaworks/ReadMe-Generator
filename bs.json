"\n        # Tims-Password-Generator\n\n## Description\n\nThis project solves the security concern of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be promted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.\n\nThe new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.\n\nThe criteria that the password is able to meet are: <br>\n\n1) the password is between 8 - 128 characters long, AND <br>\n\n2) the password must have at least one of the following character types: <br>\n    *lowercase characters <br>\n    *uppercasse characters <br>\n    *special characters <br>\n    *numeric characters <br>\n\n## The final product\n https://timothy-wesley.github.io/password-generator/\n\n<img src=\"example1.png\" alt=\"picture of password generator\"> <br>\n<img src=\"example2.png\" alt=\"picture of completed password\"> <br>\n\n        "
