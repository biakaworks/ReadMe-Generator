This project solves the security concern of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be promted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.

![Image of Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ReadMeGen-v1.0-green)

The new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.

The criteria that the password is able to meet are: <br>

1) the password is between 8 - 128 characters long, AND <br>

2) the password must have at least one of the following character types: <br>
    *lowercase characters <br>
    *uppercasse characters <br>
    *special characters <br>`;

    fs.writeFile(filename, template, (err) =>
      err
        ? console.log(err)
        : console.log("Success! Thanks for using ReadMe_Generator")
    );
  });
